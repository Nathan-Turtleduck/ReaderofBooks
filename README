# Project 04: Reader of Books

* Author: Nathan Maroko
* Class: CS121 Section 2
* Semester: Fall 2019

## Overview

This java application displays a GUI which allows the user to enter a csv file
full of book objects. Buttons are made out of these objects and allow the viewer to choose
which book they would like to read.

## Compiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:
```
$ javac ReaderOfBooks.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java ReaderOfBooks
```

You will be prompted to input a csv file containing books.
From there it is entirely up to the user what they would like to do with
the program.
